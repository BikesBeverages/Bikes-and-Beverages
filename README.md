# GIS-5574: Bikes and Beverages

Intelligent routing for bike-brewery/bike-distillery tours of the Twin
Cities using on-sale and off-sale liquor license data and simulated
annealing for maybe-optiaml route determination. Random routes, route
suggestions based on distance criteria, and customizable routes.

## Purpose

You like to bike. You're a discriminating consumer of craft beer and
spirits. You enjoy mixing the two. You go into a day (or night)
thinking to yourself, "I want to visit five taprooms today." Or, maybe,
I'd like to bike about 30 miles and visit 

## Extensibility

You can easily extend this to include arbitrary place-types (e.g.,
maybe you want to visit various libraries in the Twin Cities). No
assumptions
