# Basemap

We should style a basemap based on week 8 exercises using Google Maps.

## Resources

* [features that can be styled](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference?hl=en#MapTypeStyleFeatureType)
* [map options](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference?csw=1#MapOptions)
* [BicyclingLayer](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/layer-bicycling)

## Consider

* Emphasize known bike routes
* Deemphasize highways and anything that won't allow riders, but leave them for reference
* Strip out basic administrative things
* Strip out most business-like things; we know the businesses we want to display
